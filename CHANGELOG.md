## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate
### Changed

* Updated to `defmt` 1.0 (non-breaking change, backwards compatible with 0.3 through semver trick)

## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-13
### Added
* `Copy`, `Clone` and `Hash` on error & event types (where possible)
### Changed
* The MSRV has been updated to 1.81.0 due to `core::error::Error` being implemented
* **BREAKING**: The `parse` API has been replaced with `Parser::new` where `Parser` now implements `Iterator` and the `next` function returns each parsed command
  * Accordingly, the features `use_alloc` and `use_heapless` have been removed.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-11-14
### Added
* Add support for using [`alloc::vec::Vec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/vec/struct.Vec.html)
### Changed
* Due to dependency updates the MSRV has been updated from 1.60 to 1.62. This should only be relevant if you use the `defmt` feature, but we now only test with 1.62 and not older releases, so it's not guaranteed to work otherwise.
* Update to `heapless:0.8.0`
### Breaking Changes
* You must now select either the feature `use_alloc` or `use_heapless` for the crate to compile. Select `use_heapless`
  to keep the API from the previous release of this crate.

## [0.1.1] - 2023-01-07
### Changed
* The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) has been defined as 1.60.0 and is being enforced in `Cargo.toml`
